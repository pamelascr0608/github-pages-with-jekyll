  This is my first blog post ever and I don't know how to start, but I'm glad to meet you here. In this blog I will try to give you some tips and contents that I learn each day in programming. I know that sometimes all you need is somebody who passed through the same bug that you're freaking out for hours to share some tips and help. Here I am. By the way, feel free to send me an [email](mailto:pamelaschavesresende@gmail.com) ou a mesage at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pamela-resende/). See you!
